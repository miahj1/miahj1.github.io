# Goal
There are graphics that show up at the end of the year on Spotify from an event called wrapped. 
Wrapped puts together meaningul statistics about the user's listening activity. The issue with 
the current state of the graphics is that they are not as meaningful as sought out to be. There's
this really odd ball limitation of only allowing mobiles users to generate or even look
at the graphics--users who actively use the desktop or web player are ignored. After the event is over,
there's no way to access those graphics again. If let's say a user wanted to see the ones from
past years of active listening, they aren't able to. These are many of the pitfalls that come with
this event.

Wrapped shows statistics in 
1. Top 5 Genres
2. Listening Personality Calculation
3. Minutes Listened, Top Artists, Top Songs, and Top Genre
4. Audio Day
5. Top Song
6. Amount of Artists Listened To
7. [Audio Aura](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/learn-more-about-the-audio-aura-in-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-with-aura-reader-mystic-michaela/)
